# Convecterm
See some nice convection in your terminal:

Convecterm uses the stokes-flow equations with eulerian advection-diffusion to give you some nice convective behavior in your terminal. It has temperature-dependent viscosity, and (obviously) temperature-dependent densities. It uses finite-differences in a pretty stock-standard way. It does not use any dynamic memory calls, which was a deliberate choice.

It's pretty sensitive to parameter changes, so take it easy when playing with them.
